# STM32F103 Libraries

These libraries are using the STM Peripheral Library (SPL) include files, and some source files.  In practice, there are alternative implementations for the source files to

  * Simplify the usage
  * Support non-blocking calls
  * Support Contiki style task synchronization, http://www.contiki-os.org/
