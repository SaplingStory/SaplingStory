##Libraries
These libraries are developed on top of the Standard Peripheral Libraries (SPL) that can be automatically included in EmBitz when starting a new project.

In the previous Wiki (F401/F429), the libraries followed theme used in SPL, where the source files (*.c) were in "src" folder and header files (*.h) were in "inc" folder.
In the F103 Wiki, there are subfolders for each library and those subfolders do contain all involved files.

The standard files from STM, such as SPL, and EmBitz, such as project files (*.ebp), loader files (*.ld), and initialization assembly files (*.S) are not included in this GitHub.  They are created by EmBitz as part of the development process.

##Applications
The libraries do include examples to demonstrate the capabilites of the libraries.  More extensive demonstrations using multiple libraries, are in the **Applications** folder.
